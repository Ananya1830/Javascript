// As we know javascript is a sequential running language. Every sequence is run after another sequence.

//some events happen on the browser which are evoked after any kind of activity.

//These activity is known as the events.

//The activity can be of many types as mouse hovering, mouse clicked, double clicked, keyboard's value clicked, drag and drop, etc.
 

// let us target the <li> with the id of "owl"  
//  <li><img width="200px" id="owl" src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/3532552/pexels-photo-3532552.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1600&lazy=load" alt="" onclick="alert('owl clicked')"></li>

// 1st approach

//Writing onclick="" in an html tag itself  for a click event may not be a very good approach when the scale is large.
// It is not recommended

// 2nd approach 

//document.getElementById("owl").onclick = ()=> {
 //   alert("owl is clicked")
//}
// This approach can also be accepted but the event listener features not only provides the click events but also different events.
// So this approach is also not recommended.

// 3rd or best approach 

// In this approach we have to target the id as always.
// and with event listener () we give the type of event and another parameter as false which is by default.
/*document.getElementById("owl").addEventListener("click", (e)=> {
     alert("owl is clicked again")
},false)*/

//We also get an event object

document.getElementById("owl").addEventListener("click", (e)=> {
     alert("owl is clicked again")
     console.log(e);
     console.log(e.currentTarget);
     console.log(e.target);
     // we get the browser event as well as environmental events
     console.log(e.clientX);
     console.log(e.clientY);
     console.log(e.screenX);
     console.log(e.screenY);
     console.log(e);
     
    
     //We get the browser event as well as environmental events

},false)

// topics should be studied about the below event object's topic

// type, timestamp, defaultPrevented, target, toElement , srcElement, currentTarget , clientX, clientY, screenX , ScreenY 

// e.type

console.log(e.type); // click
 // It returns the result as a string and the result would be the type of event.

// e.timestamp
console.log(e.timeStamp); // 1423.45444 (in milli second)

// The timeStamp event property returns the number of milliseconds from when the document was finished loading until the specific event was created.
// Not all systems provide this information, therefore, timeStamp may be not available for all systems/events.

// defaultPrevented

// The defaultPrevented event property checks whether the preventDefault() method was called for the event.
// as we know the preventDefault() method holds the value 

// target

console.log(e.target);

// The target property returns the element where the event occurred.

// toElement
  console.log(e.toElement());
// It's a property of the event object (e) that retrieves a reference to the element that the mouse pointer entered during specific mouse events.


// currentTarget

  console.log(e.currentTarget);

// the currentTarget property returns the element whose event listener triggered the event.

// clientX

 console.log(e.clientX);

// The clientX property returns the horizontal client coordinate of the mouse pointer when a mouse event occurs.
// It only shows the value if the gets clicked in the client Area.
// The client area is the current targeted (event occurring) window.

// clientY

 console.log(e.clientY);

// The clientY property returns the vertical client coordinate of the mouse pointer when a mouse event occurs.
// It only shows the value if the gets clicked in the client Area.
// The client area is the current targeted (event occurring) window.


// screenX
 console.log(e.screenX);

//The screenX property returns the x (horizontal) coordinate of a window, relative to the screen.

//screenY

  console.log(e.screenY);

 //The screenY property returns the y (vertical) coordinate of a window, relative to the screen.

 // EVENT PROPAGATION
 
// Event propagation is a mechanism that defines how events propagate or travel through the DOM tree to arrive at its target and what happens to it afterward.

// There are two ways 

// 1.Event bubbling

// When an event happens first the event target all goes through the event handler or the targeted element, then to its parent element.
// It is called an event bubbling
// As we learned the parameter given while adding an event listener the third parameter needed to be given as false.
// No 3rd parameters also refer to false by default.

// example



document.getElementById("owl").addEventListener("click", (e)=> {
     console.log("owl is clicked ")
},false)

document.getElementById("images").addEventListener("click", (e)=> {
     console.log("image  is clicked ")
},false)


/* the result is
owl is clicked (1st)
image  is clicked (2nd) 
*/

// As we know the "images" id is the parent of the "owl" id.
//If we click on the owl image (with the false parameter or no parameter), first it targets the child then the parent.
// It travels bottom to top in dom tree
// It is called as event bubbling.

// 2. Event capturing
// It first captures  the outermost element and propagates to the inner elements.
// It travels from top to bottom or from parents to children.
// with the true parameter mentioned

// EXAMPLE

document.getElementById("owl").addEventListener("click", (e)=> {
     console.log("owl is clicked ")
},true)

document.getElementById("images").addEventListener("click", (e)=> {
     console.log("image  is clicked ")
},true)


/*
result 
image  is clicked (1st)
 owl is clicked    (2nd)
 */
